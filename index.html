		<h1 style="color: #374C64;" align="center">Best Japanese Animated Film Directors</h1>
		<p align="justify"><strong>Anime</strong>  (Japanese: アニメ, plural: anime) is a Japanese term for hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese, where this term references all animation.</p>
		<p align="justify">The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917, and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily. The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century, developing a large domestic and international audience. </p>
		<p align="justify">The anime industry consists of over 430 production studios, including major names like Studio Ghibli, Gainax, and Toei Animation. Despite comprising only a fraction of Japan's domestic film market, anime makes up a majority of Japanese DVD sales. It has also seen international success after the rise of English-dubbed programming. </p>
		<p align="justify"><strong>Our goal with this page is to show three of the best animated film directors japan has today.</strong> We know there are others well-known recognized directors but we decided to start with these three and expand our data base later.</p>

		<p align="justify"><strong>Makoto Shinkai</strong>  was born as Makoto Niitsu in February 9, 1973. He is a Japanese director, writer, producer, animator, editor, cinematographer, voice actor, manga artist and former graphic designer. A native of Nagano Prefecture, Shinkai studied Japanese literature at Chuo University where he was a member of juvenile literature club where he drew picture books. He traces his passion for creation to the manga, anime, and novels he was exposed to while in middle school. His favorite anime is <i>Castle in the Sky</i> by Hayao Miyazaki. Shinkai has been called "The New Miyazaki" in several reviews, including those by Anime Advocates and ActiveAnime—comparisons which he himself calls an "overestimation".</p>
